# 📓 Python Programming - Error Handling and Debugging
---

## 🟢 1. Try-Except Blocks

**Error handling prevents programs from crashing due to unexpected issues.**

The basic structure:

```python
try:
    # Code that might raise an error
except:
    # Code to handle the error


➤ **Example:**



```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(f"Square: {num**2}")
except Exception as e:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.\nException:", e)
```

## 🟢 2. Catching Specific Exceptions

```It's better to catch specific exceptions to handle different errors appropriately.```



```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Division by zero is not allowed.")
except Exception as e:
    print("An unexpected error occurred:", e)
```

## 🟢 3. Using else & finally

- **else:** Runs if no exceptions occur.  

- **finally:** Runs no matter what (cleanup code).



```python
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a positive number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input.")
else:
    print(f"You entered: {num}")
finally:
    print("This always runs.")
```

## 🟢 4. Generating and Creating Custom Exceptions

- You can use `raise` to generate exceptions.

- Custom exceptions are created by defining a new class that inherits from `Exception`.


**➤ Raising Exceptions Example:**


```python
age = -5

if age < 0:
    raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative.")
```

**➤ Custom Exception Example:**


```python
class NegativeAgeError(Exception):
    pass

age = -5

try:
    if age < 0:
        raise NegativeAgeError("Age cannot be negative.")
except NegativeAgeError as e:
    print(e)

```

## 🟢 5. Problem-Solving Strategies

✅ Understand the error message.  

✅ Use print statements or debugging tools to trace the problem.  

✅ Break the code into smaller parts.  

✅ Handle exceptions gracefully using try-except blocks.  

✅ Anticipate common errors (e.g., invalid input, division by zero).  

✅ Write custom exceptions for specific situations.  

### **🎯 Quick Recap**
✅ Use try-except to catch errors and prevent crashes.  

✅ Catch specific exceptions for better error handling.  

✅ else and finally provide structured error handling.  

✅ Custom exceptions allow for clear, descriptive error messages.  

✅ Debugging is an essential skill for reliable code.  

### **📝 Practice Exercises**

1. Write a program that asks for two numbers and divides them. Handle:
   - ValueError for invalid inputs
   
   - ZeroDivisionError for division by zero

2. Create a custom exception called `PasswordTooShortError` if the entered password is less than 8 characters.

3. Demonstrate the use of `else` and `finally` in a simple program that reads a file.

4. Intentionally raise an exception if a negative number is entered for age.
