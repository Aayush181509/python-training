## üü¢ 1. Conditional Statements

**Conditional Statements in Python:**
- Used to make decisions based on conditions.

- Keywords: `if`, `elif`, `else`.


```python
# Simple if-else
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")

# if-elif-else
marks = 85

if marks >= 90:
    print("Grade: A+")
elif marks >= 75:
    print("Grade: A")
elif marks >= 60:
    print("Grade: B")
else:
    print("Grade: C")
```

## üü¢ 2. Loops

**Python supports two main types of loops:**
1. `for` loop ‚Üí Iterate over sequences (strings, lists, tuples, etc.)

2. `while` loop ‚Üí Repeats while a condition is True


**‚û§ For Loop Example:**


```python
# Loop over a range of numbers - For loop example
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
```


```python
# Loop over a list - For loop example
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

**‚û§ While Loop Example:**


```python
# Print numbers 1 to 5 using while loop
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```


```python
# Print even numbers from 1 to 10 using while loop
count = 1
while count <= 10:
    if count % 2 == 0:
        print(count)
    count += 1
```

## üü¢ 3. Looping Over Tuples, Strings, & Dictionaries


```python
# Tuple
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
for color in colors:
    print(color)

# String
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

# Dictionary
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 21}
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

## üü¢ 4. Special Loops: for/else

#### The `else` block after a `for` loop executes if the loop completes normally (no `break`).



```python
# Check if a number is prime
num = 7
for i in range(2, num):
    if num % i == 0:
        print(f"{num} is not prime.")
        break
else:
    print(f"{num} is prime.")
```

## üü¢ 5. Nested Loops and Flow Control


```python
# Nested loop for multiplication table
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        print(f"{i} x {j} = {i * j}")
    print("---")
```

## üü¢ 6. Special Statements: pass, continue, break


```python
# pass - placeholder
for i in range(3):
    pass  # Does nothing, placeholder for future code

print("="*5)
# continue - skip current iteration
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
print("="*5)
# break - exit loop
for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        break
    print(i)
print("="*5)
```

## üü¢ 7. Resolving Real-World Problems

**Let's solve a simple real-world problem using control structures.**



```python
# Simple password validation
correct_password = "python123"
attempts = 3

while attempts > 0:
    pwd = input("Enter password: ")
    if pwd == correct_password:
        print("Access granted!")
        break
    else:
        print("Incorrect password. Try again.")
        attempts -= 1

if attempts == 0:
    print("Access denied. Too many failed attempts.")

```

## üéØ Quick Recap

‚úÖ Use `if`, `elif`, `else` for decision-making  

‚úÖ `for` and `while` loops help with repetition  

‚úÖ Loop over sequences like tuples, strings, dictionaries  

‚úÖ Special loop structures: `for/else`  

‚úÖ Use `pass`, `continue`, `break` for flow control  

‚úÖ Practice solving real-world problems  

## üìù Practice Exercises

1. Write a program that checks whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.

2. Print all even numbers from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop.

3. Create a simple calculator using `if-elif-else`.

4. Use nested loops to print a pattern like:
```
*
**
***
****
*****

******
*****
****
***
**
*

     *
    ***
   *****
  *******
 *********
***********
```
5. Write a program to validate password input with a maximum of 3 attempts.
