# üìì **Python Programming -** File Handling
---

## üü¢ 1. Text File Operations

### Python provides easy ways to handle files for reading and writing.

**Common File Modes:**
- `'r'` ‚Üí Read (default)

- `'w'` ‚Üí Write (overwrites existing file or creates new)

- `'a'` ‚Üí Append (adds to existing file)

- `'rb'` / `'wb'` ‚Üí Read/Write binary files

**‚û§ Reading a Text File:**


```python
# Writing sample content for demonstration
with open("../files/sample.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is a text file.\nSecond line of text.")

# Reading file
with open("../files/sample.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**‚û§ Writing to a Text File:**


```python
with open("../files/output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a new file.\nFile handling in Python is easy!")
```

## üü¢ 2. File Path Handling with os Module

**The `os` module helps work with file paths in a platform-independent way.**


```python
import os

# Current working directory
print("Current Directory:", os.getcwd())

# Create a file path
file_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), "output.txt")
print("File Path:", file_path)
```

## üü¢ 3. Working with CSV Files

**CSV (Comma-Separated Values):**
- Simple format for storing tabular data.
    
- Python provides the `csv` module to work with CSV files.


**‚û§ Reading a CSV File:**


```python
import csv

# Creating a sample CSV file
with open("../files/data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 23])
    writer.writerow(["Bob", 28])

# Reading the CSV file
with open("../files/data.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

```

**‚û§ Using Dictionaries in CSV Files:**


```python
# Writing using DictWriter
with open("../files/data_dict.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    fieldnames = ["Name", "Age"]
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    writer.writerow({"Name": "Charlie", "Age": 30})
    writer.writerow({"Name": "Dana", "Age": 26})

# Reading using DictReader
with open("../files/data_dict.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)
```

## üü¢ 4. Working with JSON

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**
- Popular data format for exchanging data.

- Similar to Python dictionaries.


**‚û§ Reading & Writing JSON:**


```python
import json

# Python dictionary
person = {"name": "Eve", "age": 29, "skills": ["Python", "Data Science"]}

# Writing to JSON file
with open("../files/person.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(person, file)

# Reading JSON file
with open("../files/person.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
    print(data)

```

**‚û§ Parsing JSON Strings:**


```python
# JSON string
json_str = '{"name": "Frank", "age": 32}'

# Converting JSON string to dictionary
person = json.loads(json_str)
print(person["name"])
```

**Example Prompt to ChatGPT:**
```
"Generate Python code to read a JSON file containing student records and print their names."



### **üéØ Quick Recap**

‚úÖ File operations: reading, writing, appending  

‚úÖ Use `os` module for file path handling  

‚úÖ CSV files: `csv.reader`, `csv.writer`, and dictionaries  

‚úÖ JSON: Read, write, parse structured data  

### **üìù Practice Exercises**

1. Write a program to create a text file with your name and age.

2. Read the file you just created and print its contents.

3. Create a CSV file with three student records (name, age).

4. Read and print all names from the CSV file.

5. Write a program to save a dictionary as a JSON file and read it back.
