# 📓 **Python Programming - Data Structures**
---

## 🟢 1. Lists

**Lists in Python:**
- Ordered, mutable (can be changed) collection of items.

- Can store mixed data types.


```python
# Creating a list
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)
```

**➤ Indexing, Slicing & Negative Indexing:**


```python
# Indexing
print(fruits[0])  # First item
print(fruits[-1])  # Last item

# Slicing
print(fruits[0:2])  # First two items

```

**➤ Looping Through Lists & Conditions:**


```python
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit.startswith("b"):
        print(f"{fruit} starts with 'b'")
```

**➤ Useful List Methods:**


```python
# Adding items
fruits.append("orange")
print(fruits)

fruits.insert(1, "mango")
print(fruits)

# Removing items
fruits.remove("banana")
print(fruits)

# Sorting
fruits.sort()
print(fruits)
```

**➤ List Comprehension with Conditions:**


```python
# Create list of squares for even numbers from 0 to 10
squares = [x**2 for x in range(11) if x % 2 == 0]
print(squares)
```

## 🟢 2. Tuples

**Tuples:**
- Ordered, immutable collection.

- Faster than lists.

- Suitable for fixed data.



```python
# Creating a tuple
dimensions = (10, 20, 30)
print(dimensions)

# Indexing and Slicing
print(dimensions[1])
print(dimensions[:2])

# Looping
for dim in dimensions:
    print(dim)

```

**➤ List vs Tuple:**

- List: **Mutable** → You can modify contents.

- Tuple: **Immutable** → Contents cannot be changed.

- Lists have more built-in methods compared to tuples.

- Use lists for homogeneous items and tuples for heterogeneous items.




**➤ Switching Between Lists and Tuples:**


```python
# List to Tuple
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = tuple(my_list)
print(my_tuple)

# Tuple to List
new_list = list(my_tuple)
print(new_list)
```

**➤ Tuple Unpacking:**


```python
person = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")
name, age, profession = person
print(name, age, profession)
```

## 🟢 3. Sets

**Sets:**
- Unordered collection of unique items.

- Used for mathematical operations like union, intersection, etc.

**➤ Basic Set Operations:**


```python
# Creating sets
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
print(colors)

# Adding, Removing, Discarding
colors.add("yellow")
print(colors)

colors.remove("green")  # Raises error if not present
print(colors)

colors.discard("purple")  # No error if not present
print(colors)

```

**➤ Set Operations:**


```python
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
b = {3, 4, 5, 6}

print("Union:", a | b)
print("Intersection:", a & b)
print("Difference:", a - b)
```

**➤ Frozenset vs Set:**

- `set` → Mutable  

- `frozenset` → Immutable  


```python
fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
print(fs)
```

## 🟢 4. Dictionaries

**Dictionaries:**
- Collection of key-value pairs.

- Keys must be unique.


**➤ Creating & Accessing:**


```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 22, "grade": "A"}
print(student["name"])
```

**➤ Useful Dictionary Methods:**


```python
# Get with default
print(student.get("age"))
print(student.get("major", "Not specified"))

# Update
student.update({"grade": "A+", "major": "CS"})
print(student)

# Keys, Values
print(student.keys())
print(student.values())

# Pop
student.pop("age")
print(student)

```

**➤ Dictionary Comprehension:**


```python
# Squares of numbers
squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
print(squares)

# Filtering even squares
even_squares = {k: v for k, v in squares.items() if v % 2 == 0}
print(even_squares)

```

**➤ Nested Dictionaries:**


```python
# Student with nested details
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "subjects": {"Math": 90, "Science": 95}
}

print(student["subjects"]["Math"])
```

### 🎯 Quick Recap

✅ Lists → Ordered, mutable  

✅ Tuples → Ordered, immutable  

✅ Sets → Unordered, unique items  

✅ Dictionaries → Key-value pairs  

✅ Use list/dictionary comprehension for concise code  

### 📝 Practice Exercises
